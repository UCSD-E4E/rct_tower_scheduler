I commented out most of the stuff we had in order to focus on the small
piece I was working on. I included a beginning "active_ensembles.json"
file that only says the next_ensemble is -1. Once you compile the
exscheduler.cpp file and run it, the active list will be built in that
file and next_ensemble will be overwritten to 0. Right now it only copies
the function names, ensemble titles, and times but it should be easily
extensible to include function arguments (if we can ever get the
Callable studd to work). 

I included a pdf of the control flow but mine is a little uglier than
yours but I think it will make sense.

Also I expanded the dummy ensembles to include more for testing things out,
and this version ignores the "next_time" parts because it doesn't need them.
